            <h4> What is Carpool?</h4>
            <p> Carpool is a ridesharing service for working professionals that was founded in Orange County in 2015. It was built on the belief that people waste too much time sitting in their cars. That time could be better utilized doing productive things. Carpool helps to ease that wasted time, by decreasing time of commutes, and allowing people to make connections with other professionals in the area.</p>
            <h4> Why Carpool?</h4>
            <ul>
              <li> Saves time spent sitting on the freeway</li>
              <li> Saves money on gas</li>
              <li> Allows you to make new friends with other professionals</li>
              <li> Helps lower your carbon footprint</li>
            </ul>
            <h4> Who does it benefit?</h4>
            <p> Carpool is for working professionals who want to save time and money on their commutes. If you are a professional with a long commute, Carpool is perfect for you!</p>
